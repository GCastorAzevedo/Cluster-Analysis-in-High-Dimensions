# Cluster-Analysis-in-High-Dimensions
My master's thesis, accompanied with some (non-optimized) implementation of the Orclus algorithm (by Charu Aggarwal)

Here I present my master's thesis, together with two important papers that underlined the development of the main algorithm of this work. The thesis can be used as an introduction to Clustering Analysis, so many others references can be found on the bibliography.

The two articles uploaded in this repository can be accessed for free at: http://charuaggarwal.net/research.html . I highly recommend to acces other resources from this page, as its author, Charu Aggarwal is a prolific researcher in many Machine Learning domains of study.

I also give some code implementing the ORCLUS algorithm (depicted in "Finding Generalized Projected Clusters in High Dimensional Spaces"). This is just a sketch, absolutely non-optimized. My plans are to rewrite it on C, allowing some parallel computing enhancements, embedding afterwards into a newly optimized Pyhon package. 

For R developpers, excelent algorithms can be found at https://crantastic.org/packages/orclus .
