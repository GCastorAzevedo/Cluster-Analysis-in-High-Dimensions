# Cluster-Analysis-in-High-Dimensions
My master's thesis, accompanied with some (non-optimized) implementation of the Orclus algorithm (by Charu Aggarwal)

Here I present my master's thesis, together with two important papers that underlined the development of the main algorithm of this work. The thesis can be used as an introduction to Clustering Analysis, so many others references can be found on the references.

The two articles uploaded in this repository can be accessed for free at: http://charuaggarwal.net/research.html . I highly recommend to acces other resources from this page, as its author, Charu Aggarwal is a prolific researcher in many Machine Learning domains of study.
